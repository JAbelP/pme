            <p className='p-6 text-left'>
            Our expert team is ready to handle and wire your new generator directly
             into your service panel or transfer switch. Doing this will make 
             sure that the electricity is transferred safely into the home and

              result in back firing, back feeding, carbon monoxide and other 
              hazards, so make sure you have your generator installed by a 
              certified professional every time.
